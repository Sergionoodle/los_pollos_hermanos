                        <p>Los Pollos Hermanos is a fast-growing casual family restaurant founded by Gus Fring and his
                            business
                            partner Max Arciniega. Together, the "chicken brothers" made a name for themselves and their
                            small-town
                            eatery by using authentic flavors and spices to make the tastiest chicken south of the
                            border.
                            Since then, Los Pollos Hermanos has opened our doors in the United States, serving families
                            just
                            like yours. And we look forward to continued growth!</p>
